Cleared Salesforce Service Cloud Consultant – My Prep Journey


Hi everyone! Just wanted to share that I’ve officially passed the Salesforce Service Cloud Consultant exam. It wasn’t easy, but the right resources really made a difference.

About the Exam:
* 60 questions
* 105 minutes
* Mix of multiple choice and multi-select

A Bit About Me:
* 3 years of experience with Salesforce, mainly Service Cloud
* I already had the Admin and App Builder certs

What Helped Me Prepare:
* Trailhead’s Service Cloud modules – good for fundamentals
* Focus on Force – great for deeper understanding
* CertifieDumps – their practice questions were super close to what I saw on the actual exam

Study Time:
* Around 3 weeks of focused prep, including hands-on practice

If you’re planning to take this exam, definitely get in some practice with realistic questions. Certifiedumps helped me spot weak areas and feel ready on exam day. Wishing you all the best in your prep!
